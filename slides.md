# A new IoT landscape: the Pervasive Computing world

- The expansion of the IoT has led to the spread of computational power, embedded in our everyday environment.
- In this new world, computation is pervasive and almost invisible to the user.
- A new type of system emerges from this context: the Collective System.

## Collective Systems

- CSs are systems composed by smaller systems.
- These subsystems accomplish a *collective task*, strongly relying on the subsystem's interaction.
- CSs are inherently adaptive: CASs as a relevant study case.
